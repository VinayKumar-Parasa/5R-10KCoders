<h1>Online Ticket Booking</h1>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>It was in August 1999, when Hemrajani struck upon idea of selling movie tickets online to eliminate queues outside movie theatres in India. He was thinking for some time as to why there was no other way to find out the availability of movie tickets rather than stand in long queues. Backpacking from Johannesburg, he quit his job with J Walter Thompson, the advertising company and decided to start his own venture to provide an answer to this problem; this was how Bookmyshow was born. Hemrajani had done his MBA in marketing from Sydenham Institute of Management, Mumbai. Once back in India he shared this idea with his friends and two of them, Praikshit Dar and Rajesh Balpande both MBAâ€™s from University of Mumbai were excited about this idea and agreed to form a company named Bookmyshow.com to develop this idea into an enterprise.</p><hr>
